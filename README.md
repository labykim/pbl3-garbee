## Naming Conventions
### Branch
> "name"/"event"\_"detail"  
> all in lowercase
> "\_" to distinguish, "-" to space

- "name" : e.g. artie, tony, alice, daffa, coco, braces
- "event" : e.g. feature, practice, bugfix, issue
- "detail" : e.g. camera, log, test, (issue number)

So, name the branch like:  
`artie/practice_test-branch`  
`tony/feature_image-upload`  
`alice/issue_17`
